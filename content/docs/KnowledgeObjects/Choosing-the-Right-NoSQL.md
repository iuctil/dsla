# Quick Comparions of NoSQL Databases

Over the past decade, the interest and demand of NoSQL databases have increased dramatically. 

Relational databases are known for robustness and consistency, and have been the major players in the DB market for a long time. However, when they handle large-scale data, they suffer from scalability and bad performance.  NoSQL is complementary to SQL and it has various formats for storage that can support large volume of different types of data with high velocity.

There are hundreds of different NoSQL databases available today and it is difficult to find the right database for your task.  We will compare several popular NoSQL databases.

NoSQL DBs are not an exception to CAP Theorem which states that a distribute data store is unable to provide all three of consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance at the same time.

## Characteristics of NoSQL Databases

- NoSQL databases, in general, can be categorized into key-value, document, and column stores, or graphs based on their storage model, and each offers different solutions.

- Key-value store DBs are simplest and designed to store data with no schema Column Store DBs are designed to store large volumes of columns.

- Document base DBs are more complex data and designed to store, manage and extract info in and from document.

- Graph DBs are based on on graphs that have interconnected components and relations between them.
