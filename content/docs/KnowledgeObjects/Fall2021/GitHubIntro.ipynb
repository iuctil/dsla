Git is an open source software that allows multiple people to work on a single web page. In short, git is the engine of collaboration, and GitHub is the vehicle. Git is a command line tool that allows for a push and pull between local files and a web repository. "

    "But what makes GitHub any better than using something like Google Collab, or simply sharing files? The catch all phrase is version control. The idea of version control is that a single piece of software is being built by multiple people at multiple times. When working amongst multiple collaborators you need a good way to keep track of the changes that each person makes and the different phases of work being done. You can see what this looks like below"
